## "Tinder" for Custom Keyboards

The ***Control_Shift*** app aims to act as a place for users to upload custom keyboard photos for people to vote/rate. The idea is for the app (in the future) to provide users with product recommendations for any combination of the following: keyboard size; layout preference; keycap profile; keycap designs; switch types and variations; mods; etc.

*(Yes, basically the r/mechanicalkeyboards subreddit)*

### Why "Ctrl Shift"?

It's *reeeally* hard to come up with a catchy name! In this case, "Ctrl + Shift" seemed appropriate, since it was traditionally the key combination used to switch between different keyboard layouts (when more than one was available). Probably not used as often these days, and other combinations might roll off the tongue better, but this seemed fine at the time.
