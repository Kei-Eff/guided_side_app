## "Tinder" for Custom Keyboards

This app will act as a place for users to upload custom keyboard photos for people to vote/rate. The idea is for the app (in the future) to provide users with product recommendations for any of the following: keyboard size/layout preference; keycap profile; keycap designs; switch types and variations; etc.

App name TBC.
